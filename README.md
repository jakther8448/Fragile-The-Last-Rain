# 🌧️ Fragile: The Last Rain

*Fragile: The Last Rain* is an atmospheric puzzle-platformer that blends delicate paper-world aesthetics with a hauntingly emotional narrative.  
You play as **Lin**, a small origami child made of paper, who awakens in a city built entirely from folded cardboard and ink.  
The world is fragile, creased, and dying — an endless storm looms overhead, and the first drop of rain means certain death.

Your goal: **find the mythical "Paper Heart"** — a relic said to grant permanence before the storm dissolves the world completely.

Everything in this world is vulnerable.  
Water destroys, fire consumes, and time unravels all folds.

### Gameplay:
- **Environmental Puzzles:** Push, pull, climb, and fold through collapsing paper structures.  
- **Folding Mechanics:** Transform between paper forms — a gliding plane, a slipping sheet, or a defensive box.  
- **Dynamic Threats:** Avoid spreading **Ink Beasts** — living stains that dissolve the world.  
- **Atmospheric Storytelling:** No dialogue. Surreal Soundtrack tells a story.  

**Ink Beasts** are visualized as moving stains — swirling masses of sketch-like fur with glowing cyan eyes and teeth.
